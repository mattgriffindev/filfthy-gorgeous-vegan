 - Some actions can only be performed by authorised users, e.g. only an admin can add, edit, or delete categories.

  ![admin categories](cakebox/static/img/admin-categories.png)

 - Users can only edit or delete their own recipes.

  ![user edit](cakebox/static/img/user-edit.png)

![Brand font](cakebox/static/img/brand-font.png)

The primary font is Didact Gothic with a sans-serif fallback font.

![Primary font](cakebox/static/img/primary-font.png)

The signature font is M PLUS 1 Code with a cursive fallback font.

**Imagery**

The hero image is a vegan cake in keeping with the theme of the site.

The images in the quicklinks section are also vegan cakes.

**Interactive links**

The site includes internal hyperlinks to the different pages of the site and external hyperlinks to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, which open in a new browser tab.

The site includes two email address hyperlinks that will automatically open a user's email application and autofill the email address in the "To" field, the subject 'Mail from our site' in the "Subject" field, and the text 'Thank you for contacting us. Please let us know how we can help you...' in the body.

**Wireframes**

Wireframes for desktop and mobile views were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/ "Balsamiq").

[View the desktop and mobile wireframes here](docs/wireframes/ "Wireframes")

Wireframes were created for desktop and mobile views only. It was considered that this would be sufficient to inform the layout of the tablet view.

Similarly, wireframes were created for the homepage, recipes page, and full recipe page only. It was considered that this would be sufficient to inform the design of other pages.

**Database scheme**

PostgreSQL manages the data for the recipe categories and users.

MongoDB manages the data for the recipes.

A copy of the original report can be accessed [here](docs/tests/html-validator-1.pdf "W3C Markup Validator report").

A copy of the final report can be accessed [here](docs/tests/html-validator-2.pdf "W3C Markup Validator report").

A copy of the report can be accessed [here](docs/tests/css-validator-1.pdf "W3C CSS Validator report").

**Lighthouse etsting**

The website was tested using Lighthouse on the Chrome and Microsoft Edge browsers to determine the websiteâ€™s performance, accessibility, best practices, and SEO.

For desktop, all measures scored at least 90% 

For mobile, the performance measure scored 83% and 87% on Chrome and Edge respectively. This was considered acceptable at this time; however, the developer may look to improve this in the future.

The reports can be viewed below:

- [Chrome Desktop](docs/tests/lighthouse-chrome-desktop.pdf "Chrome Desktop report")

- [Chrome Mobile](docs/tests/lighthouse-chrome-mobile.pdf "Chrome Mobile report")

- [Edge Desktop](docs/tests/lighthouse-edge-desktop.pdf "Edge Desktop report")

- [Edge Mobile](docs/tests/lighthouse-edge-mobile.pdf "Edge Mobile report")

**a11y color contrast accessibility validator**

The [ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://color.a11y.com/Contrast/ "ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator") was used to test for color contrast problems. The Validator retuend 1 problems with contrast color-pairs. These problems were resolved by adjusting the contrast of the font color.

A copy of the original report can be accessed [here](docs/tests/a11y-contrast-checker-1.pdf "ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator report").

A copy of the final report can be accessed [here](docs/tests/a11y-contrast-checker-2.pdf "ally Color Contrast Accessibility Validator report").

**Responsiveness testing**

The website's responsiveness was tested manually, using the Google Chrome DevTools, and the [Responsive Design Cheker](https://responsivedesignchecker.com/ "Responsive Design Checker") website.

The website was responsive on all screen sizes from 320x480px to 1920x1200px.

**Known Bugs**

No bugs have been identified.
